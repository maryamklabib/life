Daily Check-ins:
- [ ] **Mind** :iphone: I wasted time. Sadly. Too much Facebook. Gonna make a social media curfew.
- [ ] **Body** :zzz: I'm not sleeping well. I'm eating meh.
- [ ] **Soul** :pray: I missed Fajr. This better not happen again. Seriously get your life together.

Daily Goals:
- [x] **Mind** :heartpulse: [Did my day 2 of algorithms](https://github.com/maryamklabib/100-days-of-algorithms/blob/master/day2-factorial.rb)
- [x] **Body** :dancer: Got my cardio in.
- [ ] **Soul** :books: I cannot focus enough to remember anything in Zumar. This is because I've filled my head with too much trashy music.
InshaAllah tomorrow I'm only listening to Quran. FIGHT FOR YOUR AKHIRAH MARYAM.
